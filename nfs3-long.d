 * Report long NFS read/write/commit operations.
 *
 * usage: nfs3-long.d [verbosity [delay]]
 *
 * verbosity 0 is the default. 'nfs3-long.d 0 <delay>' is valid to just
 * set the delay.
 * verbosity 1 shows filenames when available.
 * verbosity 2 also shows currently active request counts on a per-pool
 *	basis.
 * delay is in milliseconds and defaults to 500 msec.
 *
 * <when> LONG NFS ...		- long NFS read/write/commit operations;
 *				  it's normal for 'commit' operations to
 *				  report 0 bytes.
 * <when> LONG NOP ...		- long other NFS operations; the operation
 *				  is reported but there is no IO size et al.
 *
 * A 'txg +<number>' is reported if a transaction group committed in the
 * ZFS pool between the start and the end of the operation. The <number>
 * is how many transaction groups committed.
 *
 * ASSUMPTION: all exported filesystems are ZFS filesystems. This is
 * true in our environment.
